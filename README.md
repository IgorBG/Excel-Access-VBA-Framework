# Excel-Frontend
This modules are created for processing buisness tasks on data managing.
I use this modules for different tasks. I haven't uploadaed all the modules, because there is lot of confidential data in it. Still I am looking forward to upload the necessery files after cleaning them 

These modules bring:
- Excel as frontend for MS Access databases (E.g. retrieve data from DB to worksheet, batch edit in Excel, uploading data back to DB; or upload data from your excel files to a DB).
- Flexibility in creating reports, product labels with pictures, etc. Batch edit of necessery data before printing.
- Interactive data on worksheets - (E.g. showing some additional data on the order after double click on a cell; Double click a cell and pick a value from pop-up screen's list, populated dynamically from database)
- A set of functional user-forms, which are dynamic and event based (you can process the data outside the form's module, keeping the form interactive)
